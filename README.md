Project Name: MedClarity 

Description:
This project creates a virtual assistant powered by a large language model (LLM) to provide clarity and information on medical billing and costs. The system leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance the LLM's understanding of user queries before generating informative responses.

Key Features:
RAG-based LLM: User queries are directed to a pre-trained RAG vector table for additional context, improving the LLM's comprehension of medical billing terminology and processes.
Medical Cost Estimation: The assistant can estimate potential costs for various medical procedures based on user-provided details (limited to non-personalized data).
Medical Billing Explanation: The assistant can help decipher medical bills, explain charges, and answer questions about insurance coverage.
User-Friendly Interface: The assistant can be integrated into various platforms (e.g., website chat, mobile app) for a seamless user experience.

System Architecture:
User Interface: Users interact with the virtual assistant through a user-friendly interface.
Query Processing: The user's query is processed and pre-processed for clarity.
RAG Lookup: The query is directed to a pre-trained Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) vector table to retrieve relevant context about medical billing and costs.
LLM Processing: The enriched query, along with retrieved context, is passed to the large language model for information retrieval and response generation.
Response Generation: The LLM generates a comprehensive response that addresses the user's query, potentially including cost estimates, billing explanations, or additional resources.
Response Delivery: The system delivers the generated response to the user through the chosen user interface.
